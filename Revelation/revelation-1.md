This is a guided reading of Revelation 1 by Saint Kris of Judah

**Revelation (1:1)** This is the revealing of Yhwhshai the Christ, which God gave unto John of Patmos, to show his servants things which will **shortly** come to pass

Shortly here is not as we think of in our human sense of time. 
We can see that below in our precepts 

2nd Peter 3:8 --> One day is likened to a thousand years (in gods time) 
Hosea (6:1) He had us torn (slavery)
Hosea (6:2) After two days will he revive us (2 Thousand Years), In the 3rd day he will raise us up. 
To revive us (awaken us to the truth), raise us up (to our former glory). 

These things are being show unto his servants. Who are his servants? 
Leviticus (25:55) Unto me the children of Israel are servants 

**Revelation (1:2)** John bare recored of the word of god (Yhwhshai). 

**Revelation (1:3)** Blessed is he that readeth, and that hears the words of prophecy, and keep those things that are written therein: for the time is at hand. 

Isaiah (34:16) Seek out the book of the lord. None of the promises shall fail. Gods spirit gathered the current records that we have.

1st Kings (8:56) Not one word of all his good promises shall fail

Daniel (9:2) he based his studies on books (the writings) 

Romans (10:17) Read so that you can build faith by hearing the word

**Revelation (1:4)** peace from Christ to the seven churches that are in asia minor

Acts 6:9 - Synagogues of the libertines, cyrenians, and alexandrians 


**Revelation (1:5)** Christ is the faithful witness, and the first begotten of the dead 

**Isaiah (55:4)** christ was given as a witness to the people 

**1 Corinthians (15:20)** Christ was the first to rise from the dead

How to build faith?

Romans (10:17) so then faith cometh by hearin, and hearing by the word of God.

Foot notes about John the Revelator, John the Divine, also called John the Apostle

Matthew (4:20) Simon called peter & his brother andrew left to follow christ with no excuses 
--> In a similar fashion John did. 

John (1-4) --> John is often referred to as "the disciple whom Christ loved". 

John (19:25-27) --> He told his mother that John was now her son, and to john that she was now his mother.

John (21:20-23) --> Peter turned and saw john following, Peter asked who would betray him, and what shall this man do (asking about john), Christ said follow me don't worry about him. 

Peter interpreted this and told his bretheran that John the Disciple should not die. Peter clarified by saying thats not what he said, he just said if i will him to wait until i come, what is that to you. 

John (21:24-25) John is the disciple which testifieth of these things & if he testified all the good
that christ did the world itself could not contain the books that should be written. Amen. 

Revelation (10:11) --> Christ said to john, you must prophesy again before peoples, nations, and tongues, and kings. He was to be reincarnated. He died on patmos so he must still do this.
