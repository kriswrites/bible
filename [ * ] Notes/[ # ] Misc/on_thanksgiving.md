The Pilgrims had hardly explored the shores of Cape Cod for four days before they had robbed the graves of my ancestors and stolen their corn and beans.

The "first Thankskilling", as a lot of folks understand it, was in 1621 between the Pilgrims of Plymouth Colony and the Wampanoag tribe in present-day Massachesetts. 

Wampanoag are the tribe of Gad who are the so-called Native Americans 

There's [no evidence that the Wampanoag people were even invited]() in the first place. A account from the time says 90 members of the Wampanoag tribe were present and makes no mention
of invitations. Some experts believe that these 90 men [were an army, sent by Wampanoag leader Ousamequin at the sound of gunshots]() Which turned out to be part of the celebration. 

In their first encounter with the Wampanoag people, the Pilgrims stole from the tribe's winter provisions --it wasn't until later that Ousamequin formed an alliance between groups. Even then, 
the alliance really only existed because the Wampanoag people were ravaged by diseases brough by European colonizers in the years prior. It was less about intercultural harmony and more about survival made
necessary by the actions of these settlers. 

Hab 2:5 --> He sins by his philosiphies, he does not stay in his homeland, he consumes like the grave, and he brings nothing but sin and death until all nations and all peoples. 

Pope Alexander VI gave a decree in AD 1493 to Colonize, Convert, and Enslave named "Inter Caetera" in which he authorizes spain and portugal to colonize the Americas and its Native peoples as subjects. The decree
asserts the rights of Spain and Portugal to colonize, convert, and enslave. It also justifies the enslavement of Africans. 

Dan 8:25 --> He destroys the mighty and the holy people, he destroys wonderfully. His power is mighty. He will prosper from his wickedness, He will magnify himself in his heart, he will be peace destroy many, he will stand
up against the prince of princes but he shall be destroyed. In his policy he shall cause craft to proser in his hand. 

Prov 26:24 --> when you hate someone you lie to them. 

Prov 26:25 --> when he says sweet things do not believe him for he has 7 (many) abominations in his heart. His hatred is covered by deceit (laws and policies) 

Psa 55:20 --> he breaks his covenants, his words are smoother than butter but he has war in his heart. His words were softer than oil, yet were they drawn swords. 

1 Macabees 1:29-31 --> he spake peacable words, but it was for deceit. He took spoils and set them on fire, the women and the children they took and possessed the cattell. 

Wisdom of Solomon 2:10 --> Let us leave a token (relic, monument, building) of our joyfulness in every place; for this is our portion let us opresse the poore righteous man, let us not spare the widow nor the ancient. 
Let our strength be the law of justice.
