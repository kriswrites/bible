# Biblical Teachings on Praying in Public - Kris Yotam
**Date:** November 26, 2024

## Introduction
The Bible emphasizes the importance of private, sincere prayer and warns against the desire to pray for public recognition or to impress others. While prayer is vital, the heart behind it is what truly matters to God. This guide explores what the Bible says about praying in public and how to approach situations where one may be asked to pray in public.

## Key Scriptures on Public Prayer

### **Matthew 6:5-6**
- **Summary:** Jesus warns against praying in public for the sake of being seen by others. Instead, He teaches to pray in private, where only God sees, and God will reward openly.
- **Key Point:** "And when thou prayest, thou shalt not be as the hypocrites are: for they love to pray standing in the synagogues and in the corners of the streets, that they may be seen of men. Verily I say unto you, They have their reward. But thou, when thou prayest, enter into thy closet, and when thou hast shut thy door, pray to thy Father which is in secret; and thy Father which seeth in secret shall reward thee openly."

### **Matthew 6:7-8**
- **Summary:** Jesus also warns against using vain repetitions in prayer, which may be a temptation in public prayers, seeking to impress with eloquence rather than sincerity.
- **Key Point:** "But when ye pray, use not vain repetitions, as the heathen do: for they think that they shall be heard for their much speaking. Be not ye therefore like unto them: for your Father knoweth what things ye have need of, before ye ask him."

### **Luke 18:9-14 (The Parable of the Pharisee and the Publican)**
- **Summary:** Jesus shares the parable of a Pharisee who prays publicly to be seen by men, and a tax collector who prays humbly in private. The tax collector’s prayer is heard, showing that humility and sincerity are key in prayer.
- **Key Point:** "Two men went up into the temple to pray; the one a Pharisee, and the other a publican. The Pharisee stood and prayed thus with himself, God, I thank thee, that I am not as other men are... but the publican, standing afar off, would not lift up so much as his eyes unto heaven, but smote upon his breast, saying, God be merciful to me a sinner. I tell you, this man went down to his house justified rather than the other."

### **Proverbs 25:14**
- **Summary:** This verse warns against boasting about prayers or spiritual acts, which can be seen in public prayer as an attempt to gain recognition.
- **Key Point:** "Whoso boasteth himself of a false gift is like clouds and wind without rain."

### **1 Thessalonians 5:17**
- **Summary:** Paul encourages believers to pray without ceasing, meaning that prayer should be a continual part of one's life, whether public or private.
- **Key Point:** "Pray without ceasing." 
  - While this encourages constant prayer, it doesn’t endorse making every prayer public or for show.

## When Asked to Pray for Others in Public

### **Matthew 18:19-20**
- **Summary:** While Jesus does not forbid public prayer, He promises to be present where two or more are gathered in His name, suggesting that group prayer can be powerful and beneficial.
- **Key Point:** "Again I say unto you, That if two of you shall agree on earth as touching anything that they shall ask, it shall be done for them of my Father which is in heaven. For where two or three are gathered together in my name, there am I in the midst of them."

### **Acts 12:5**
- **Summary:** The early church gathered in private for prayer, but it was still a collective and powerful form of intercession.
- **Key Point:** "Peter therefore was kept in prison: but prayer was made without ceasing of the church unto God for him."
  - Public prayer in a group context is acceptable when the focus is on sincere intercession and not public display.

### **Galatians 6:2**
- **Summary:** Praying for others is a form of bearing one another's burdens, but it should be done humbly and with the right heart, not for outward recognition.
- **Key Point:** "Bear ye one another's burdens, and so fulfill the law of Christ."
  - Praying for others, even in public, is an act of love and service, but it should be done in humility, not to be seen.

### **James 5:16**
- **Summary:** Confessing faults and praying for one another in community is encouraged, but the emphasis is on sincerity and the power of prayer rather than the location or public nature.
- **Key Point:** "Confess your faults one to another, and pray one for another, that ye may be healed. The effectual fervent prayer of a righteous man availeth much."

## Key Principles on Praying in Public
- **Humility:** Public prayer should never be done for the sake of recognition. Our prayers are for God, not to impress people (Matthew 6:5-6).
- **Sincerity:** Prayer should be heartfelt and genuine, not just a performance (Matthew 6:7-8, Luke 18:9-14).
- **Private vs. Public:** While public prayer is not inherently wrong, it should be avoided if the motivation is to be seen or praised. Private prayer is often more pleasing to God (Matthew 6:6).
- **Praying for Others in Public:** If asked to pray for someone in a group setting or public gathering, do so with the right heart. It's acceptable to intercede for others, but it should be done with humility, not for show (Matthew 18:19-20, Acts 12:5).
- **Group Prayer:** Praying in a group is encouraged when the focus is on mutual support and intercession, not individual recognition (James 5:16, Galatians 6:2).

## Conclusion
The Bible encourages private, humble prayer focused on God rather than public displays of spirituality. While it is acceptable to pray in public, the motivation must be pure, and the prayer must be sincere, not for the sake of recognition. Prayer is a personal conversation with God, and public prayer should reflect that intimacy and humility.
