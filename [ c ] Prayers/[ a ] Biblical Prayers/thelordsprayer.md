### **The Lordâ€™s Prayer (Our Father)**  
**Scripture:** Matthew 6:9-13; Luke 11:2-4

**Prayer:**

Our Father in heaven,  
Hallowed be Your name.  
Your kingdom come.  
Your will be done, on earth as it is in heaven.  
Give us this day our daily bread.  
And forgive us our debts, as we forgive our debtors.  
And do not lead us into temptation, but deliver us from the evil one.  
For Yours is the kingdom and the power and the glory forever. Amen.
