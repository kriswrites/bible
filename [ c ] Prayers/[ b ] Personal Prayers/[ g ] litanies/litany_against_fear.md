# Litany Against Fear
____

I shall not fear.  

Fear is the faith killer.  

Fear is the gateway to sin, and sin is the beginning of death.

Fear distorts the word of life.  

I will not let fear control me.  

I will not fear the future.  

I will rest in God's love.  

I will face my fear, and when it has passed, I will remain in the peace of God.
