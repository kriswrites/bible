____

I will not yield to sloth

I will not be idle in my calling

I will rise from indifference

I will embrace the work of my hands

I will resist laziness

I will not make excuses but act in faith

I will be diligent and faithful

I will work heartily for the Kingdom of God

I will not be overcome by slothful thinking

I will press on toward the goal

Where sloth once held sway, there will be vitality

Only diligence will remain
