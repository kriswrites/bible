I will not harbor envy

I will not be consumed by comparison

I will rejoice in the blessings of others

I will resist the temptation to covet

I will cultivate gratitude for all that God has given me

I will seek contentment in God's provision

I will trust that God's plans for me are good

I will choose kindness over jealousy

Where envy once sought to destroy, there will be Joy

Only Peace will remain
